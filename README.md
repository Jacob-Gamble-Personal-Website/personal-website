Building a Personal Website

In the beginning, there was a blank slate,
An eager dev, couldn't hardly wait.
He opened his editor, fingers ready to type,
The first web page, he'd create tonight.

And he said, "Let there be light,"
On his screen, the code took flight,
HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript,
His creation, a website, a new life to live.

He crafted his header, a logo with style,
Navigation links, stretching a mile.
A hero image, with colors so bright,
A call-to-action, bold in the night.

And he said, "Let there be light,"
On his screen, the code took flight,
HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript,
His creation, a website, a new life to live.

Responsive design, from desktop to mobile,
Flexbox and Grid, making it all viable.
A touch of animations, transitions so smooth,
As he previewed his site, he couldn't help but groove.

Finally, the moment had come,
To share his creation, his race now run.
He pushed it live, to the world wide web,
A masterpiece born, from his very own head.

And he said, "Let there be light,"
On his screen, the code took flight,
HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript,
His creation, a website, a new life to live.

So here's to the web devs, who create and explore,
Building new worlds, forevermore.
With each line of code, a new story begins,
A digital canvas, for our dreams to live in.e

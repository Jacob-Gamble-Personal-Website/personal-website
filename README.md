Building a Personal Website

In the beginning, there was a blank slate,
An eager dev, couldn't hardly wait.
He opened his editor, fingers ready to type,
The first web page, he'd create tonight.

And he said, "Let there be light,"
On his screen, the code took flight,
HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript,
His creation, a website, a new life to live.

He crafted his header, a logo with style,
Navigation links, stretching a mile.
A hero image, with colors so bright,
A call-to-action, bold in the night.

And he said, "Let there be light,"
On his screen, the code took flight,
HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript,
His creation, a website, a new life to live.

Responsive design, from desktop to mobile,
Flexbox and Grid, making it all viable.
A touch of animations, transitions so smooth,
As he previewed his site, he couldn't help but groove.

Finally, the moment had come,
To share his creation, his race now run.
He pushed it live, to the world wide web,
A masterpiece born, from his very own head.

And he said, "Let there be light,"
On his screen, the code took flight,
HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript,
His creation, a website, a new life to live.

So here's to the web devs, who create and explore,
Building new worlds, forevermore.
With each line of code, a new story begins,
A digital canvas, for our dreams to live in.e


General styling: BLACK OUT THEME
__________________________________
***The theme I am going for is what I imagine after looking at the sea creatures in the deepest depths of the ocean that glow bright fluorescent colors, lighting up areas but with a northern lights meets a fluorescent orange color scheme***

Overall color scheme: 
-Transparent black with black "engraved" text,with a transparent looking fluorescent orange >fluorescent green gradient as back ground of
each section of the page 
-"Blacked out" buttons that have 2 tones of darkness, a transparent black with the embedded/engraved text that is not transparent and dark black, on mouse hover 
buttons to glow fluorescent orange and/or fluorescent green color 	
-The main Flexbox Carousel and Lower CSS Grid sections will have backgrounds that are vibrant bright glowing  fluorescent orange ---> fluorescent green gradient with rounded edges and transparent I want
everything on the page to be "blacked out and readable. but when hovering over one side of the page the colors emit a fluorescent color correspondent to the background gradient from where the user is hovering on the page.




1.Header:
_________
-A small transparent "blacked out" header bar  with a sticky position, so it remains visible when scrolling.
-My name on the right side of the header in fluorescent orange that glow
-Social media icons on the left-side, evenly spaced and styled as buttons that are "engraved" into the bar dark black and when hovered over they "emit" an fluorescent orange or green glow glow  fluorescent orange and/or fluorescent green color when hovered. 
-Include buttons for : LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, and substack.
-Between my name and the socials icon I will have "Socials:" as a h1 tag aligned to the center, that is always glowing fluorescent orange/green with an arrow that when clicked emits a fluorescent green and/or orange glow and you and can drag down over the flexbox section and stops at the grid section of the page to see a transparent blacked out "About" page, that contains a description of who I am/whoami in fluorescent green and/or orange color
The social media icons should look like they are

2.Flexbox section: A Flexbox Carousel(MAIN FOCAL POINT) 
_______________________________________________________

-The flexbox carousel will have items that contain a thumbnail image, a title, and a short description of what each project is.
-Flip through the carousel to  view all of my projects by hitting an embedded arrow "engraved" button that will glow fluorescent green and/or orange, when hovered over  on the thumbnail image of "My Work"
-One project on the Carousel showing at a time, clicked will take you to the project's website


3.Lower Section: A CSS Grid layout with a responsive design
_______________________

-3 columns spaced evenly between one another to showcase the following:
Grid Column 1- "My Skills": Technologies I know and use regular 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Grid Column 2-"Learning" Technologies that I am interested in learning/learning now 
***Like the Socials Icons in the header bar these will be blacked out and when hovered over will glow but only to the colors that they are typically. IE: React will be a blacked out React icon and when hovered over, it will glow teal, JS yellow etc. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grid Column 3- Open sourced or personal projects I have contributed to, instead of icons, it will be very small thumbnails that light up when hovered over, when clicked it will take you to the github repository's
-In each column the technologies will be represented by their corresponding icons, t

Each column will be "blacked out" unless hovered over, but leaves a glowing trail that fades away if not hovered back over for a few seconds AND have glowing fluorescent borders always.


4.Footer:

Same style has the header just has: 
Tech stack icons used to create the page, copyright information and  privacy policy.
no special buttons but text will emit fluorescent glow when hovered over
